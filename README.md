# MGDL
## Mathematic Game Development Library

Welcome to MGDL! 
This is a mathematical library made **_from game developers_ to _game developers_** so **YOU** can easily inegrate mathematical logic and features into your project. Everything in this project is well documented and comented so **YOU** can understand how and why does it work. **MGDL** is built on Unity due to it's big popularity in indie game development. Unity's editor version for project is **_[2023.2.19f1]_** but it may be updated in future.
